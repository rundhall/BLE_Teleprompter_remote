Bluetooth remote for teleprompter

In this instruction, I will show you how I created a DIY remote controller for an android based teleprompter. Here is a link, if you do not know what a teleprompter is:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter. Recently because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I had to record a lot of presentations. Using a teleprompter made my presentations more professional. There are many applications available to use the phone as a teleprompter. The only problem is that the speed of the text is sometimes to slow, sometimes too quick. I needed a tool to control the speed remotely. I bought a Bluetooth remote controller, but it was too noisy, every time I used it, it made a clicking sound which was noticeable in the recording. My goal was to build a Bluetooth remote which is silent and easy to customise.
In this video I show how to use the device, and how to build it. 
The remote controller has a switch on the top of the enclosure. With that, the unit can be turned on or off. It has 5 buttons; each button can be configured as any keyboard button. Before the first use, it has to be paired with the phone. At Bluetooth settings search for new Bluetooth devices, it will pop up in the list as “BLE_Teleprompter”.
